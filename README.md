I think conda recipes are way easier than writing setup.py for python packages.  If you are in an environment where you don't need to publish to pypi, and conda is sufficient (think enterprise) this can be a much easier way to build packages, rather than fiddling with setup.py options, diagnosing issues with include_package_data and pacakge_data_dirs for non python includes (think html template directories)
